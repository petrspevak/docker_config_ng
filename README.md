# Docker configuration for some specific Symfony projects

***This is a work in progress***

1. I use this docker configuration for some specific projects built on the Symfony framework and custom bundles.
2. It's possible to edit the configuration for usage with other Symfony projects.
3. I'm not a Docker expert, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.
4. Designed for development environment only.
5. Files usage:
    - The content of [.env.example](.env.example) file is to be copied to `.env` file.
    - [README.md](README.md) file can be removed, renamed, or handled as needed.
    - All other files and directories are just to be added to the standard Symfony project structure.
