# Docker configuration for some specific Symfony projects

***This is a work in progress***

- I plan to widely use this docker configuration for some specific projects built on Symfony framework and custom bundles.
- It's possible to edit the configuration for usage with another Symfony projects.
- I'm not a Docker expert, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.
- Designed for development environment only.
- It's configured to just add these files to standard Symfony project structure.
